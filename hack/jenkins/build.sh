# kubernetes-build job: Triggered by github checkins on a 5 minute
# poll. We abort this job if it takes longer than 10m. (Typically this
# job takes about ~5m as of 0.8.0, but it's actually not completely
# hermetic right now due to things like the golang image. It can take
# ~8m if you force it to be totally hermetic.)
